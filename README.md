## 1. Time series visualization 
    Visualizes the time serie  x(n) = k * n whwn k is a constant.  
    It illustrates the time series on a circle by connecting each n to x(n)  
    for k=2 we have  
    n = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}  
    x(n) = {2, 4, 6, 8, ...}  
    It then animates the time series with an increasing k.
